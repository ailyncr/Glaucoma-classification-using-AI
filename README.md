## Image Classification with CNN

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify glaucoma images into three categories: Normal, Early, and Advanced. The model uses Conv2D layers with L2 regularization, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout to reduce overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 77.18%. Training metrics such as accuracy and loss are monitored and visualized.
